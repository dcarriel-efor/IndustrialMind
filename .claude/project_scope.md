# IndustrialMind - Project Scope

## Project Overview
**IndustrialMind** is a comprehensive, portfolio-grade Industrial AI Platform designed as a 12-month learning journey to master production-level data science and ML engineering skills.

## Core Objectives
1. **Skill Development**: Transform from intermediate to advanced-level ML engineer
2. **Portfolio Building**: Create a production-ready, open-source project showcasing end-to-end ML capabilities
3. **Career Advancement**: Target $200K+ ML engineering roles in top-tier companies

## Primary Learning Goals
- Master **PyTorch** for deep learning (critical skill gap)
- Implement production **MLOps** pipelines
- Deploy at scale using **Kubernetes** and cloud platforms
- Build advanced **LLM/RAG** systems with fine-tuning
- Establish comprehensive **monitoring & observability**

## Target Stack

### Data Layer
- Apache Kafka (streaming)
- InfluxDB (time series storage)
- PostgreSQL (metadata)

### ML Layer
- PyTorch (models)
- Hugging Face (transformers)
- ONNX (model optimization)

### Knowledge Layer
- Neo4J (graph database)
- ChromaDB (vector store)
- LangChain (orchestration)

### MLOps Layer
- MLflow (experiment tracking)
- DVC (data versioning)
- Docker (containerization)
- Kubernetes (orchestration)

### Cloud Layer
- AWS SageMaker / Azure ML
- AWS Lambda / Azure Functions
- Terraform (IaC)

### Frontend
- Next.js (main dashboard)
- FastAPI (backend API)
- Streamlit (ML demos)

## Expected Outcomes

### Technical Portfolio
- 1000+ commits on production-quality code
- Published fine-tuned LLM on Hugging Face
- Live deployment with full MLOps pipeline
- Technical blog posts demonstrating expertise
- Demo video showcasing the platform

### Career Impact
Target roles and salary ranges:
- Switzerland: Senior ML Engineer (CHF 140-170K)
- UAE: ML Lead (AED 500-650K, 0% tax)
- UK: Staff ML Engineer (£100-130K)
- USA: Senior MLE ($180-250K)

## Project Philosophy
> "The best way to learn is to build something real."

Instead of: Learn → Learn → Learn → Build
We do: **Build → Learn WHILE building → Ship → Iterate**

**Every week you ship something. Every feature teaches a skill.**

## Success Metrics
- Complete all 12 monthly milestones
- Achieve portfolio-ready status
- Pass AWS ML Specialty exam
- Submit 50+ job applications
- Secure multiple interview opportunities
