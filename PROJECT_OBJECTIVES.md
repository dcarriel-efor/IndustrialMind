## Skill Development Strategy

### "Learn by Building" Philosophy
Instead of traditional learning: Theory → Practice → Project
We use: **Project → Theory (as needed) → Practice → Ship**

### Weekly Cadence
- **Monday**: Plan week's deliverable
- **Tuesday-Thursday**: Build and implement
- **Friday**: Test and validate
- **Saturday**: Document and polish
- **Sunday**: Review, reflect, plan next week

### Monthly Milestones
Each month has:
1. **Clear Goal**: What capability are we adding?
2. **Key Deliverable**: What gets shipped?
3. **Skills Acquired**: What did we learn?
4. **Checkpoint**: Verification before proceeding

## Key Principles

### Quality Over Speed
- Production-ready code from day one
- Proper error handling and logging
- Comprehensive testing
- Clear documentation

### Practical Over Theoretical
- Every feature solves a real problem
- Focus on what's needed for the project
- Learn theory only when directly applicable
- Ship working solutions regularly

### Portfolio-Driven Development
- Every commit contributes to the narrative
- Code quality matters for showcase
- Documentation explains decisions
- Demo-ready at every milestone

## Target Audience for Portfolio

### Companies
- Google, Microsoft, Amazon (Big Tech)
- Roche, Novartis (Swiss Pharma/Biotech)
- G42, ADNOC (UAE AI/Energy)
- Revolut, Wise (FinTech)
- Industrial AI startups

### Roles
- Senior ML Engineer
- Staff ML Engineer
- ML Lead / Principal MLE
- MLOps Engineer
- AI Platform Engineer

### Required Skill Demonstrations
✅ PyTorch production models
✅ End-to-end MLOps
✅ Cloud deployment at scale
✅ Real-time data processing
✅ LLM/RAG systems
✅ Graph ML applications
✅ Monitoring and observability

## Accountability Framework

### Weekly Check-ins
Every Sunday:
1. What did I ship this week?
2. What's the goal for next week?
3. What's blocking me?
4. What did I learn?

### Monthly Reviews
At month end:
1. Milestone achieved? (Yes/No)
2. Quality assessment (1-10)
3. Skills gained verification
4. Adjustments needed for next month

### Project Health Metrics
- Commit frequency (target: 5+ per week)
- Code quality (linting, tests passing)
- Documentation coverage
- Demo functionality
- Learning progress
